Hurray another post!!!
Last two weeks I've been working pretty hard on MovieCast and am happy to announce that we have some alpha versions available for you to try out.
Don't expect much from these builds yet, we just want to give ya'll the opportunity to feel the slickless of MovieCast.
Below are some screenshots on the current looks of MovieCast:

_The detail pane for movies, clearly unfinished, fix it Grey :P_

_The settings pane. We clearly love Material Design_

## The Alpha Builds
So like i stated before we now have public alpha builds, unfortunally we don't have a good way to publish them yet,
however you can download the artifacts from the [AppVeyor builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ItsDizzy/moviecast-desktop).
Everytime we push code to GitHub, AppVeyor will build a new setup, which you can then download.

If you just want the current build from two days ago, download the setup [here](https://fastdl.absolutedivinity.net/moviecast/MovieCast-0.0.1.67-win64-Setup.exe).
Just be aware this will be out to date pretty quickly.

## More?
Yus there is more...
If I am correct Grey will start on our new website, this time properly styled :P _PS: I hope Material <3_
Our main goal with this new website is to be ready for whenever we release, gotta have dat site ready right?
Is there even more then more? Nope this is enough for now...
